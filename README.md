# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Overview
**This is a web-based Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is designed for two players to play against each other, taking turns to place their symbols (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to align three of the same symbol in a row, column, or diagonal to win. If the grid is completely filled and no player has won, the game results in a draw.**

## Features
- **Two-player mode (X and O).**
- **Simple and responsive 3x3 grid layout.**
- **Automatic checks for winning combinations (rows, columns, diagonals).**
- **Draw detection when the board is full without a winner.**
- **Reset functionality to restart the game.**

## Technologies Used
- **HTML for the game structure.**
- **CSS for styling and layout.**
- **JavaScript for game logic and interactivity.**

## How to Play
1. **Open the game in a web browser.**
2. **The game begins with Player 1 as "X" and Player 2 as "O".**
3. **Players take turns clicking on an empty cell to place their symbol.**
4. **The game automatically checks for a winner after each move.**
5. **If a player successfully aligns three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, a victory message is displayed.**
6. **If the board is full and no winner is declared, the game ends in a draw.**
7. **Use the "Reset" button to start a new game.**

## Game Logic
**The game board is represented as a 3x3 grid using an HTML table or divs. JavaScript handles player turns, updates the board, checks for win conditions (three in a row, column, or diagonal), and declares the winner or a draw. CSS is used to style the board and display messages.**

## Example of Gameplay
1. **Player 1 clicks on the top-left square.**
2. **The board updates with an "X" in that square.**
3. **Player 2 clicks on the center square, placing an "O".**
4. **The game continues until a player wins or the board is full.**

## Future Enhancements
- **Add animations or effects for a more engaging experience.**
- **Include a single-player mode with AI.**
- **Create a scoreboard to track wins, losses, and draws.**
